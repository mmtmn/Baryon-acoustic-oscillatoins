Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are patterns of density fluctuations in the distribution of galaxies that can be used to measure the expansion of the universe. They are caused by sound waves that traveled through the universe shortly after the Big Bang. These sound waves caused slight variations in the density of matter, which left an imprint on the distribution of galaxies.

BAO were first predicted by theory and then observed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since then, they have become an important tool for studying the expansion of the universe and the properties of dark energy.

To measure BAO, astronomers look at the distribution of galaxies in the sky and measure the characteristic "wiggles" in the distribution caused by the BAO. They can then use these wiggles to determine the expansion rate of the universe at different times in its history.

In addition to providing important insights into the expansion of the universe, the study of BAO also helps astronomers understand the properties of dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the matter and energy in the universe.
